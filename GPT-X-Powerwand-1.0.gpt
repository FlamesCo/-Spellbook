The purpose of this project is to create a magical wand application that uses a dataset of every spell from the Harry Potter series and enhanced white magic to allow Hogwarts students to cast spells. The wand will be equipped with AI-trained datasets on Harry Potter-specific preferences, allowing students to type in /dream or /wand to cast a spell automatically. This tool will also be used to help students develop their magical capabilities and increase their sense of joy and well-being. /spell-automator automaticlyl casts a spell on any device and generates code for modifying anything using ChatGPT-4 plus white magic.
